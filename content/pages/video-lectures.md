Breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation in Diatomic Molecules
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Lectures by Professor Robert Field

This lecture series was offered during January 2005 as a follow-up to topics covered in 5.74.  Attendance was voluntary and open to any students with a background in quantum mechanics (5.61 or equivalent) and an interest in molecular dynamics.

| 1 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [Lecture 1: Introduction to the Spectroscopic Effective Hamiltonian]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lecture-1) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Description_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}} The Born-Oppenheimer approximation and matrix elements of terms in the effective molecular Hamiltonian that violate the BO approximation. Vibration, rotation, spin-orbit, interelectronic interaction. Hund's coupling cases. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

| 3 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} [Lecture 3: Semiclassical Methods for Calculating Vibrational Overlap Integrals]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lecture-3) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Description_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}} All coupling processes are mediated by vibrational overlap integrals, which are computed numerically. Semiclassical calculation of overlaps reveals physical factors controlling computed values: the length of the stationary phase region is controlled by the slopes of the potential curves at the intersection and the velocity in the crossing region. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
