description: This resource talks about 3-j for coupled - uncoupled, transformation
  of operators as well as basis states 6-j, 9-j for replacement of one intermediate
  angular momentum magnitude by another patterns ? limiting cases ? simple dynamics,
  minimum number of control parameters needed to fit or predict the I(?) or I(t).
